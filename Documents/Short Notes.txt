Resoultions Options (in Pattern Mode):
912 x 1140

24 Bit RGB Pattern Sequence streamed via DVI to mini-HDMI:
1-8 Bit Bitmap Images

Deactivate Auto Update Status

Suggested LED current Setting by Datasheet: 
104,135,130

Max Total LED Current:
4.3 Amps (?)

Sequence Settings: Pattern Source: Video port

The total number of patterns multiplied by the pattern exposure must be less than or equal to the VSYNC period

"Frame Index" can be left alone. The patterns will be pulled from the specified bit-plane(s) from each transmitted video frame sequentially


Use Browser + JavaScript + OpenCV +cpp
or MatLab (is it going to be fast enough?)

But patterns together into video file or show picture by picture? Or Gif?

Userinput?

LED only on, when color in Pattern?

912 Pixels on long edge and 1140 Pixel on short edge (https://e2e.ti.com/support/dlp__mems_micro-electro-mechanical_systems/advanced_light_control/f/924/t/636369?tisearch=e2e-sitesearch&keymatch=lightcrafter%204500%20120hz)

Pattern Mode: 8-Bit images
8Bit depth might be faster? 120 Hz 256 Bitper pixel 	=30kbps
im vergleich 			4225 Hz 1 Bit		=4kbps
BUT with 8 bit depth zeros arent readable (?)

Last Pattern always brightest without clear dmd after exposure
