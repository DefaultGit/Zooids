The DLPC350 takes at-worst-case 200 ms to load one buffer (24 bit-planes)

8Bit depth might be faster? 120 Hz 256 Bitper pixel 	=30kbps
im vergleich 			4225 Hz 1 Bit		=4kbps
BUT with 8 bit depth zeros arent readable (?)

HID too slow (64KB/sec?)

Last Pattern always brightest without clear dmd after exposure

Issues while uploading firmware: (uninstall the DLP drivers and) go into video mode, appy default solution so the buffer freeze goes away and flash again
